# R Projects

This repository contains several R projects that I completed as assignments for MATH 462 (Statistical Methods II) and 463 (Regression and Variance) at the University of Oregon. These projects are a combination of R code and written explanations formatted as R Markdown files. Each file has a title that gives an idea of the topics explored in the assignment.

PDF outputs of each project can be found in the `pdfs` folder.
